    <h2>Four Categories</h2>
    <h3>Theme</h3>
    <p>We think that our app has an easily identifiable theme.
         It shoots procedurally generated fireworks based on user specifications.
         We think that we made it somewhat special and different, especially with the rocket and randomness we added in.</p>
    <h3>User Experience</h3>
    <p>We think that the app is relatively easy to use as everything is labeled. 
        It is easy to identify what the program is and how it is used. 
        The app also runs without errors.
    </p>
    <h3>Media</h3>
    <p>
        Everything passes validation, and we met all of the requirements for styling. 
        We used the canvas API in an interesting way in order to draw fireworks using phyllotaxis. 
        We used an external stylesheet and used an embedded font from Google Fonts.
    </p>
    <h3>Code</h3>
    <p>
        We followed the normal file naminng conventions and the coding standards. 
        We used an external JavaScript file and both an external library and one that we made. 
    </p>
    <h2>Wrong and Right</h2>
    <h3>Wrong</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Having the color of the rockets shimmer with different shades</li>
        <li>Having the canvas resize as we changed the size of the window</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Right</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Getting multiple rockets working at once</li>
        <li>getting random rocket color working</li>
        <li>Allowing some variables to be rocket specific</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Non-Course Materials</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Our font (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Righteous)</li>
        <li>Rocket sound effect(https://freesound.org/people/bigpickle51/sounds/205609/)</li>
        <li>Firework sound effect(https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/328862/)</li>
        <li>Howler library that we used to implement sound(https://howlerjs.com/)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What We Think We Deserve</h2>
    <h3>95%</h3>
    <p>We put a lot of time into the project and are really happy with how it turned out. 
        We were able to fully flesh out our ideas and implement some of the things that we didn't think that we would have time for. 
        We think that we deserve a 95% for this project because we were able to fulfill all of the requirements and make something unique that we would be proud to show off.
